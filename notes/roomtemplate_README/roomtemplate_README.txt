spr_rooms contains the data for every room template in the game!
each color on the grid corresponds to a thing placed in the room, a wall, an enemy, a staircase, a chest, etc.
More colors for more objects will probably be added eventually.

DO NOT edit the rooms on the top row, those are meant to place the walls of each room, based on how many
rooms are surrounding it.

The green pixels in all of the other rooms will not be placed on generation, and are just guides to make sure
that the all the stuff in the rooms won't block any exits.

the bottom three rows are reserved for shops, treasure, and boss rooms, respectively.

in case it won't be obvious, the key won't be read by the game.
rooms with letters are placeholders.


The scanning process is really, really, slow.
